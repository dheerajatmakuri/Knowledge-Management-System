# ✅ Title/Role Extraction Improvements

## 🐛 Problem Identified

Titles/roles were only being extracted properly for the first 3 people, with the rest showing "Leadership Team Member" as the default.

## 🔍 Root Causes Found

1. **Minimum Length Constraint Too Strict**: All strategies had a minimum title length of 10 characters, which filtered out shorter titles like "CEO", "CTO", "CFO", "VP", etc.

2. **Limited Search Strategies**: Strategy 0 (link-based) only looked for elements with specific classes and didn't check sibling elements thoroughly.

3. **Insufficient Element Types**: Not checking all possible HTML elements that might contain titles (h5, h6, etc.)

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Strategy 0: Link-Based Extraction (Lines 583-620)

**Before:**
- Only looked for elements with classes matching `(title|position|role)`
- No fallback strategies

**After:**
- **3 strategies** for finding titles:
  1. Elements with title-related classes: `(title|position|role|designation|job)`
  2. Any text element (p, span, div, h3, h4) that comes after the name
  3. Sibling elements of the link
- Added intelligent filtering:
  - Skips elements that contain the name itself
  - Filters out common non-title text ("read more", "learn more", etc.)
  - Length constraint: 5-80 characters (more flexible)
  - Avoids URLs and junk text

### Strategy 1: Section-Based Extraction (Lines 678-716)

**Before:**
- Minimum title length: 10 characters
- Limited element types

**After:**
- **Relaxed minimum to 3 characters** (allows "CEO", "CTO", "CFO", "VP")
- Added h5 and h6 to searchable elements
- More flexible sibling checking

### Strategy 2: Heading-Based Extraction (Lines 742-755)

**Before:**
- Minimum title length: 10 characters

**After:**
- **Relaxed minimum to 3 characters**
- More flexible text extraction from siblings

### Strategy 3: Pattern Matching (Lines 779-781)

**Before:**
- Regex required 10+ character titles: `{10,150}`

**After:**
- **Relaxed to 3+ characters**: `{3,150}`

## 📊 Enhanced Debug Panel

Added comprehensive debug output showing:
- All extracted leaders (not just first 3)
- Title for each person
- Extraction context (which strategy worked)
- Priority score
- Image and profile URLs

## 🎯 Expected Results

**Before:**
```
1. John Smith - CEO
2. Jane Doe - CTO  
3. Bob Johnson - CFO
4. Alice Williams - Leadership Team Member ❌
5. Charlie Brown - Leadership Team Member ❌
... (all others with default title)
```

**After:**
```
1. John Smith - CEO
2. Jane Doe - CTO  
3. Bob Johnson - CFO
4. Alice Williams - VP of Engineering ✅
5. Charlie Brown - Director of Sales ✅
... (all with proper titles extracted)
```

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Refresh the app** - Changes should reload automatically
2. **Re-extract leadership** - Click "Extract Leadership" again
3. **Check the debug panel** - Expand "🔍 Debug: View Raw Extracted Data"
4. **Look for**:
   - `title` field should have actual roles (not "Leadership Team Member")
   - `extraction_context` shows which strategy worked
   - All 14 leaders should have proper titles

## 💡 What Changed Technically

### Title Length Constraints
- **Old**: `10 < len(text) < 200`
- **New**: `3 < len(text) < 200` (Strategy 0)
- **New**: `5 < len(text) < 80` (Strategy 0, text elements)

### Additional Search Patterns
```python
# Now checks:
- h3, h4, h5, h6 (not just h1, h2)
- div, span, p with ANY content
- Sibling elements (next_sibling)
- Parent containers more thoroughly
```

### Better Filtering
```python
# Skips:
- Elements containing the name
- "read more", "learn more", "view profile"
- "linkedin", "email", "phone"
- URLs (starts with 'http')
- Too short (< 3 chars) or too long (> 80 chars)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test with Amzur**: Extract from `https://amzur.com/` again
2. **Check all 14 leaders**: Verify titles are now extracted
3. **Review debug data**: Look for patterns in what's working
4. **If still missing titles**: 
   - Check debug panel for `extraction_context`
   - Look at the actual HTML structure of the page
   - May need to add more strategies for specific website structures
