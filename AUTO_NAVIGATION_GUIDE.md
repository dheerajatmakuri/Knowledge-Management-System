# 🎯 Auto-Navigation Feature Guide

## ✨ What's New?

The URL Chat Interface now has **intelligent auto-navigation** that automatically finds and navigates to the leadership/team page from any company homepage!

## 🚀 How It Works

### Before (Manual):
1. Visit company website
2. Look for "Leadership", "Team", "About Us" links
3. Click through to find leadership page
4. Copy that specific URL
5. Paste into scraper

### Now (Automatic):
1. Just paste the homepage URL: `https://amzur.com`
2. Check "Auto-navigate to leadership page" ✅
3. Click "🔍 Scrape URL"
4. **Done!** System finds and scrapes the leadership page automatically

## 📋 Features

### Smart Link Detection
The system looks for links containing keywords like:
- leadership, leaders, team, executive, management
- our-team, our-leadership, about-us/team
- management-team, executive-team, board
- directors, executives, c-suite, officers

### Priority Scoring
Links are ranked by relevance:
- **Priority 10**: "leadership" in URL or link text
- **Priority 9**: "team" in URL or link text
- **Priority 8**: "executive" in URL or link text
- **Priority 7**: "management" in URL or link text
- **Priority 6**: Other leadership-related terms
- **Priority 5**: "about" pages

### Testimonial Detection
Automatically skips:
- Customer testimonials
- Client reviews
- Case studies
- Customer success stories

### Visual Feedback
The interface shows:
- ✅ "Found and scraped leadership page!"
- 🔄 Original URL you entered
- 📍 Final leadership page URL
- Navigation path displayed

## 🎬 Example Usage

### Test with Amzur (Homepage → Leadership)

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:8503

2. **Enter homepage URL**:
   ```
   https://amzur.com/
   ```

3. **Enable auto-navigation** (checkbox is checked by default)

4. **Click "🔍 Scrape URL"**

5. **Watch the magic**:
   ```
   🔍 Looking for leadership page...
   ✅ Found leadership page: https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
   🔄 Auto-navigating to leadership page
   ✅ Found and scraped leadership page!
   
   🔄 Navigated from: https://amzur.com/
   📍 Now viewing: https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
   ```

6. **Extract leadership**: Click "👥 Extract Leadership"

7. **Result**: 14 Amzur leaders extracted! ✨

## 🌐 Test URLs

Try these homepage URLs (system will auto-navigate):

### ✅ Working Examples:
```
https://amzur.com/
https://stripe.com/
https://www.figma.com/
https://www.gitlab.com/
https://www.shopify.com/
https://www.atlassian.com/
https://www.hubspot.com/
https://www.salesforce.com/
```

### ⚠️ Edge Cases:
Some websites may require:
- JavaScript rendering (Selenium - not currently available)
- Authentication/login
- Special handling for SPAs

## 🔧 Manual Mode

If auto-navigation doesn't work:

1. **Uncheck** "🔄 Auto-navigate to leadership page"
2. **Manually find** the leadership URL
3. **Enter** the exact leadership page URL
4. **Scrape** directly

## 📊 How to Verify It's Working

### Check the logs:
```powershell
# In terminal, you should see:
🔍 Searching for leadership page on https://amzur.com/
✅ Found leadership page: https://amzur.com/leadership-team/ (text: 'Leadership Team')
🔄 Auto-navigating to leadership page: https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
```

### Check the UI:
- Green success banner: "✅ Found and scraped leadership page!"
- Navigation info showing original URL and final URL
- Leadership section shows "Auto-navigated to leadership page"

### Check the extraction:
- Click "👥 Extract Leadership"
- Should find multiple leaders (not 0)
- Names should be actual executives (not testimonials)

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

### Test 1: Amzur Homepage
```
URL: https://amzur.com/
Auto-navigate: ✅ ON
Expected: Navigates to /leadership-team/, extracts 14 leaders
```

### Test 2: Direct Leadership URL
```
URL: https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
Auto-navigate: ❌ OFF
Expected: Scrapes directly, extracts 14 leaders
```

### Test 3: Stripe Homepage
```
URL: https://stripe.com/
Auto-navigate: ✅ ON
Expected: Finds and navigates to team page
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No leadership page found?
- The website might use non-standard navigation
- Try unchecking auto-navigate and finding the URL manually
- Check if the site requires JavaScript (look for React/Vue apps)

### Found wrong page?
- The priority scoring might need adjustment
- Report the URL and we can improve the detection

### Extracted 0 leaders?
- The leadership page might use dynamic content
- Try viewing the page in your browser to verify it has leadership data
- Some sites load content with JavaScript (needs Selenium)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-hop navigation (e.g., Home → About → Team)
- [ ] JavaScript rendering with Selenium
- [ ] Machine learning for better link detection
- [ ] Sitemap.xml parsing
- [ ] Company-specific extractors (learn from patterns)

## 📝 Technical Details

### Code Location
- **File**: `src/ui/url_chat_interface.py`
- **Function**: `find_leadership_page(base_url, soup)`
- **Lines**: ~138-197

### Algorithm:
1. Parse all `<a>` tags on the page

3. Skip testimonial/customer-related links
4. Score links by priority (10=best, 5=lowest)
5. Remove duplicates
6. Return highest-scoring link
7. Recursively scrape the leadership page

### Performance:
- Link detection: <50ms
- Navigation: +1 HTTP request
- Total overhead: ~1-2 seconds

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ Enter homepage URL (not leadership URL)
2. ✅ See "Looking for leadership page..." message
3. ✅ See "Found and scraped leadership page!" success
4. ✅ See navigation path (from → to)
5. ✅ Extract leadership returns actual executives
