**Now**: Just paste the homepage - the system finds the leadership page automatically!

## 🚀 Try It Now!

### Step 1: Open the App
```
http://localhost:8503

1. **Paste this URL** (the HOMEPAGE, not the leadership page):
   ```
   https://amzur.com/
   ```

2. **Make sure the checkbox is checked**:
   ```
   ✅ Auto-navigate to leadership page
   ```

3. **Click**: `🔍 Scrape URL`

4. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - System searches for leadership links
   - Finds: `https://amzur.com/leadership-team/`
   - Automatically navigates there
   - Scrapes the leadership page

5. **You'll see**:
   ```
   ✅ Found and scraped leadership page!
   
   🔄 Navigated from: https://amzur.com/
   📍 Now viewing: https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
   ```

## 🎬 More Examples

### Example 1: Stripe
```
URL: https://stripe.com/
Expected: Auto-navigates to team page
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Algorithm:
1. **Scrape the homepage** you provide
2. **Search all links** for keywords:
   - leadership, team, executive, management
   - our-team, our-leadership, about-us/team
   - executives, directors, c-suite
3. **Score each link** by relevance (1-10)
4. **Skip testimonials** and customer stories
5. **Auto-navigate** to the best match
6. **Scrape the leadership page**
7. **Extract leadership data**

### Smart Features:
- ✅ Detects leadership vs testimonial pages
- ✅ Prioritizes "leadership" over "team" over "about"
- ✅ Handles relative URLs automatically
- ✅ Shows navigation path in UI
- ✅ Falls back to manual if no match found

## 🐛 If It Doesn't Work

### Scenario 1: Found 0 leaders
- Check if you see "Auto-navigated to leadership page"
- If yes, the page might use JavaScript (need Selenium)
- If no, try unchecking auto-navigate and finding URL manually

### Scenario 2: Wrong page detected
- System might pick "About Us" instead of "Leadership"
- Uncheck auto-navigate
- Manually find and paste the leadership URL

### Scenario 3: No navigation happened
- Page might not have obvious leadership links
- Try searching the site manually first
- Look for /team, /leadership, /about-us/team URLs

## 🎊 Success Indicators

You know it's working when you see:
- ✅ Green "Found and scraped leadership page!" message
- 🔄 Shows original URL and final URL
- 📍 Leadership page URL contains "leadership" or "team"
