# Why Extraction is Wrong & How to Fix It

## The Problem

You're seeing **incorrect data** because the extraction is finding the wrong people on the wrong page.

## What You're Probably Seeing

If you used `https://amzur.com/` (homepage), you're seeing:
- **Alex Ring** - President of CG Squared
- **Doug Angelone** - President of Khameleon Software  
- **Amanda Cole** - VP of eTeki

These are **AMZUR'S CUSTOMERS** giving testimonials, NOT Amzur's leadership team!

## The Correct Data

Amzur's actual leadership team (14 people):
1. **Bala Nemani** - President ‚Äì Group CEO
2. **Ganna Vadlamaani** - CEO, Growth Markets
3. **Sam Velu** - Director, Workforce Solutions
4. **Gururaj Gokak** - Director, Finance
5. **Muralidhar Veerapaneni** - Director, Operations
6. **Rakesh Mantrala** - Head of Marketing & Corporate Communications
7. **Sunil Kodi** - Head of Pre Sales, Partner Management & Customer Success
8. **Karthick Viswanathan** - Director ATG & AI Practice
9. **Mythili Putrevu** - Director, ERP Advisory & Netsuite
10. **Venkat A Bonam** - Director, Global Delivery
11. **Siva Jamula** - Chief Solution Architect
12. **Kamesh Doddi** - Head of Managed Infra Services
13. **Balasubramanyam Chebolu** - Head of Managed Testing Services
14. **Surya Nandarapu** - Practice Head, Custom Software

## 3 Ways to Fix This

### Option 1: Use the Correct URL (Easiest)
1. Go to http://localhost:8503
2. Click "üîÑ Clear Data"
3. Enter this EXACT URL:
   ```
   https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
   ```
4. Click "üîç Scrape URL"
5. Click "üë• Extract Leadership"
6. You should now see **14 leaders** with correct names and titles

### Option 2: Load Pre-Extracted Data (Instant)
1. Go to http://localhost:8503
2. The app now has a **"üìÅ Load JSON"** button
3. Click it to load the correctly extracted data
4. This loads the 14 leaders from `amzur_leadership.json`

### Option 3: Re-run Test Extractor
If the JSON file is missing:
```powershell
python test_amzur_extractor.py
```
This will create `amzur_leadership.json` with the correct data.

## How to Verify It Worked

After extraction, you should see:
- ‚úÖ **14 total leaders** (not 2-4)
- ‚úÖ Names like "Bala Nemani", "Ganna Vadlamaani", "Sam Velu"
- ‚úÖ **NOT** "Alex Ring", "Doug Angelone", "Amanda Cole"
- ‚úÖ Titles like "President ‚Äì Group CEO", "CEO, Growth Markets"
- ‚úÖ **NOT** "President of CG Squared" or "President of Khameleon"

## Why This Happens

The homepage (`https://amzur.com/`) has a "Benefits Delivered to Customers" section that contains:
- Customer testimonials
- Customer company names (CG Squared, Khameleon, eTeki)
- Customer executives (not Amzur employees)

The extraction algorithm correctly found people with executive titles, but they were customers, not employees!

The dedicated leadership page (`https://amzur.com/leadership-team/`) has:
- Actual Amzur employees
- Clear leadership structure
- Profile links for each person
- Proper titles and roles

## Current App Improvements

The app now:
1. ‚úÖ **Detects testimonials** and shows warnings
2. ‚úÖ **Suggests leadership pages** automatically
3. ‚úÖ **Shows what was found** after extraction
4. ‚úÖ **Allows JSON import** for pre-extracted data
5. ‚úÖ **Marks testimonials** as unselected by default

## Next Steps

1. **Clear your current data**
2. **Use the correct URL**: `https://amzur.com/leadership-team/`
3. **Extract again** and verify you see 14 people
4. **Save to database** only after verifying the data is correct

## Quick Test

Open your browser at http://localhost:8503 and:
1. Look at what's currently shown
2. If you see "Alex Ring" or "Doug Angelone" ‚Üí Wrong data (testimonials)
3. If you see "Bala Nemani" or "Ganna Vadlamaani" ‚Üí Correct data (actual leadership)

The test extractor (`test_amzur_extractor.py`) proves the logic works - it extracted all 14 leaders correctly!
