# Quick Fix Instructions for URL Chat Interface

## The Problem
The current extraction is finding **customer testimonials** (Alex Ring, Doug Angelone, Amanda Cole) instead of Amzur's actual leadership team.

## The Solution
Use the correct URL for Amzur's leadership page:
**https://amzur.com/leadership-team/**

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the Correct URL (Easiest)
1. Go to http://localhost:8503
2. Clear any existing data
3. Enter this URL: `https://amzur.com/leadership-team/`
4. Click "Scrape URL"
5. Click "Extract Leadership"
6. You should now see the actual Amzur leadership team

### Option 2: The System Will Detect It
The improved code now:
- ‚úÖ Detects when profiles are from testimonials (not leadership)
- ‚úÖ Shows a warning message when testimonials are detected
- ‚úÖ Suggests the correct leadership page URL automatically
- ‚úÖ Marks testimonial entries with ‚ö†Ô∏è warning badges

## What You'll See

When you scrape https://amzur.com/ (the homepage), you'll now see:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: The extracted profiles may be from customer testimonials, not company leadership.

Try these dedicated leadership pages instead:
- üîó https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
- üîó https://amzur.com/about-us/

üë• Extracted Leadership
Found 4 profiles (sorted by relevance)

‚ÑπÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è May be from testimonials, not company leadership

1. üë§ Alex Ring
   üìã President of CG Squared
   ‚òê Select (unchecked by default)
```

## The Root Cause

The homepage has **customer testimonials** that look like leadership profiles:
- Alex Ring - President of **CG Squared** (Amzur's customer, not Amzur leadership)
- Doug Angelone - President of **Khameleon Software** (Amzur's customer)
- Amanda Cole - VP of **eTeki** (Amzur's customer)

These are people praising Amzur's services, not Amzur's team!

## Proper Amzur Leadership

To find the actual Amzur leadership team, use:
- **Leadership page**: https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
- **About Us page**: https://amzur.com/about-us/

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Testimonial Detection**: System now detects words like "testimonial", "customer", "client", "feedback"
2. **Section Filtering**: Prioritizes sections with classes like "leadership", "executive", "management"
3. **Context Tracking**: Records where each profile was found (leadership_section vs testimonial)
4. **Smart Warnings**: Shows warnings and suggests better URLs
5. **Auto-deselect**: Testimonials are unchecked by default (won't be saved unless you check them)

## Manual Testing

Try these URLs to see the difference:

### ‚ùå Wrong URLs (will extract testimonials):
- https://amzur.com/ (homepage - has customer testimonials)

### ‚úÖ Correct URLs (will extract actual leadership):
- https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
- https://amzur.com/about-us/

## Pro Tip

The app will automatically:
1. Detect testimonial sections
2. Show you a warning
3. Provide clickable links to the correct pages
4. Just click on the suggested link and scrape that page instead!
