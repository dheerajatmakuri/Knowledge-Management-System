# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You Must Use the CORRECT URL!

## The Problem

You're trying to scrape:
- ‚ùå `https://amzur.com/` (HOMEPAGE - no leadership data)
- ‚ùå `https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/latest-news` (NEWS PAGE - no leadership)

These pages DO NOT have leadership information!

## The Solution

Use the LEADERSHIP/TEAM page URLs!

### ‚úÖ CORRECT URLs to Use:

#### Amzur:
```
https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
```
NOT the homepage! Use the `/leadership-team/` path!

#### Google Cloud:
```
https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/leadership
```
NOT `/latest-news`! Use `/leadership`!

## How to Find the Right URL

### Method 1: Check the Website Menu
Most companies have links like:
- "About Us" ‚Üí "Team" or "Leadership"
- "Company" ‚Üí "Management" or "Team"
- Direct links: `/team`, `/leadership`, `/about-us`, `/our-team`

### Method 2: Let the App Suggest It
When you scrape a wrong page, the app will suggest the correct URL!

Example from your attempts:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Only found 0 leaders. 
Suggested URLs: 
- https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
- https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/leadership
```

**Click on these suggested links and scrape THOSE pages!**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open** http://localhost:8503

2. **Clear** any existing data (click "üîÑ Clear Data")

3. **Enter the CORRECT URL**:
   ```
   https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
   ```
   (Notice the `/leadership-team/` at the end!)

4. **Click** "üîç Scrape URL"

5. **Click** "üë• Extract Leadership"

6. **You should see**: "Found: Bala Nemani, Ganna Vadlamaani, Sam Velu, Gururaj Gokak, Muralidhar Veerapaneni and 9 more..."

## Common URL Patterns

### ‚úÖ URLs That Work:
- `https://company.com/leadership`
- `https://company.com/leadership-team`
- `https://company.com/team`
- `https://company.com/our-team`
- `https://company.com/about-us` (if it has team section)
- `https://company.com/management`
- `https://company.com/executive-team`
- `https://company.com/company/team`

### ‚ùå URLs That DON'T Work:
- `https://company.com/` (homepage)
- `https://company.com/news`
- `https://company.com/blog`
- `https://company.com/products`
- `https://company.com/contact`

## Real Examples to Try

### Tech Companies:

1. **Amzur**:
   ```
   https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
   ```

2. **Stripe**:
   ```
   https://stripe.com/about
   ```

3. **GitLab**:
   ```
   https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/
   ```

4. **Figma**:
   ```
   https://www.figma.com/about/
   ```

5. **Shopify**:
   ```
   https://www.shopify.com/about/leadership
   ```

## Why This Happens

- **Homepages** typically have marketing content, hero images, product showcases
- **Leadership pages** have structured profiles with names, titles, photos
- The extractor CORRECTLY identifies when a page has no leadership data
- It then SUGGESTS the right URL for you to use

## Verification

After scraping, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Text like "Found: [Name], [Name], [Name]..."
- ‚úÖ Multiple leaders displayed (usually 5-20)
- ‚úÖ Correct titles like "CEO", "President", "Director"

NOT:
- ‚ùå "No leadership information found"
- ‚ùå "Found 0 leaders"  
- ‚ùå Testimonials or customer names

## Quick Test

Run this in your browser:

1. Go to: https://amzur.com/
   - What do you see? Hero image, services, customer testimonials
   - Any leadership section? NO!

2. Go to: https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
   - What do you see? 14 people with names and titles
   - Leadership section? YES!

**This is why you MUST use the correct URL!**

## TL;DR

```
‚ùå DON'T USE: https://amzur.com/
‚úÖ USE THIS:  https://amzur.com/leadership-team/

‚ùå DON'T USE: https://google.com/news
‚úÖ USE THIS:  https://google.com/about/leadership
```

**The extractor works perfectly - you just need to give it the right URL!** üéØ
