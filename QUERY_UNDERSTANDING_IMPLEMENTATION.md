## 🔗 Integration with Hybrid Search

The Query Understanding System seamlessly integrates with the Hybrid Search Engine:

```python
from src.search.query_understanding import QueryUnderstandingEngine
from app_hybrid_search import ProductionHybridSearchService

# Initialize both systems
understanding = QueryUnderstandingEngine()
search = ProductionHybridSearchService()

# User query
user_query = "Find senior Python developers with React experience"

# Step 1: Understand the query
result = understanding.understand(user_query, session_id=f"user_{user_id}")

# Step 2: Apply optimized strategy to search
expanded_query = f"{result.normalized_query} {' '.join(result.expanded_terms[:3])}"

search_results = search.search(
    query=expanded_query,
    vector_weight=result.search_strategy.weights['vector'],
    fulltext_weight=result.search_strategy.weights['fulltext'],
    metadata_weight=result.search_strategy.weights['metadata'],
    k=result.search_strategy.k,
    min_score=result.search_strategy.min_score,
    entity_types=result.search_strategy.entity_types,
    filters=result.search_strategy.filters
)

# Step 3: Display results with context
print(f"Intent: {result.intent.value}")
print(f"Found {len(search_results)} results")
print(f"Top match: {search_results[0].title} ({search_results[0].score:.2%})")
```

### Benefits of Integration
1. **Intelligent Search**: Queries are analyzed and optimized before search
2. **Better Relevance**: Entity extraction and expansion improve recall
3. **Adaptive Weights**: Search parameters adjust based on query intent
4. **Contextual Understanding**: Conversation history enhances multi-turn searches
5. **Filter Application**: Automatic filter detection and application
