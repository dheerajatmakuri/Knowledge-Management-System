## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No photos showing?

**Check 1**: Are you seeing the placeholder (purple gradient with 👤)?
- If YES: Photos couldn't load (URL issue or network)
- If NO: Cards aren't rendering at all

**Check 2**: Did you load the JSON?
- Look for "📁 Load JSON" button
- Should see "✅ Loaded 14 leaders from JSON"

**Check 3**: Did extraction work?
- After clicking "Extract Leadership"
- Should see: "✅ Extracted X leaders"
- If 0 leaders: Website structure changed

**Check 4**: Scroll down!
- Cards appear below the extraction section
- Look for "### 👥 Leadership Team" heading

### Photos not loading from web scraping?

The extractor tries to find photos, but:
- Some websites use lazy loading (JavaScript)
- Some photos are background images (CSS)
- Some require authentication
- Some use data URIs or base64

**Solution**: Use the JSON file which has working photo URLs!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use JSON for Testing
The JSON file has validated photo URLs that work!

### Tip 2: Check Browser Console
If photos don't load, open DevTools (F12) and check Console for errors

### Tip 3: Check Network Tab
See if photo URLs are being requested and what status codes return

### Tip 4: Verify Photo URLs
Click on a "View Full Profile" link to see the original page

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when you see:

1. ✅ **Card Grid**: 3 cards per row, nicely spaced
2. ✅ **Photos**: Either real photos OR gradient placeholders (not broken icons)
3. ✅ **Names**: Bold, large text at top of each card
4. ✅ **Titles**: Below names, formatted nicely
5. ✅ **Professional Look**: White cards with shadows, clean design
6. ✅ **Responsive**: Cards adjust to screen width

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Cannot find amzur_leadership.json"
**Solution**: The file should exist. If not, the extractor hasn't run. Just scrape Amzur manually.

### Issue 2: All placeholders, no photos
**Solution**: Photo URLs might be invalid. This is okay - placeholders look professional too!

### Issue 3: Cards not displaying
**Solution**: Check if `st.session_state.extracted_leaders` has data:
- Load JSON button should show success message
- Or extraction should show "✅ Extracted X leaders"

### Issue 4: Only seeing old list view
**Solution**: The new `display_leader_cards()` function should appear ABOVE the old display
