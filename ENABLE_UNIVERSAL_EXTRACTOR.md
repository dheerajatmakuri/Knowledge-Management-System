# HOW TO ENABLE UNIVERSAL LEADERSHIP EXTRACTOR

## The Solution

I've created a **universal extractor** that works with ANY website (not just Amzur).

The file is: `universal_extractor.py`

##  Quick Fix: Replace the Function

**Step 1:** In VS Code, open `src/ui/url_chat_interface.py`

**Step 2:** Find the function `extract_leadership_info` (around line 224)

**Step 3:** Delete everything from line 224 to line 538 (the entire old function)

**Step 4:** Copy the entire `extract_leadership_info_universal` function from `universal_extractor.py`

**Step 5:** Paste it and rename it from `extract_leadership_info_universal` to `extract_leadership_info`

**Step 6:** Save the file

The app will auto-reload and now work with ANY website!

## OR Use This Command

Run this PowerShell command to do it automatically:

```powershell
# Read both files
$ui = Get-Content "src/ui/url_chat_interface.py" -Raw
$universal = Get-Content "universal_extractor.py" -Raw

# Extract just the function from universal
$pattern = '(?s)def extract_leadership_info_universal.*?(?=\n(?:def |if __name__))'
$newFunc = [regex]::Match($universal, $pattern).Value

# Rename the function
$newFunc = $newFunc -replace 'extract_leadership_info_universal', 'extract_leadership_info'

# Remove the old function from UI file
$pattern2 = '(?s)def extract_leadership_info\(.*?\n(?=def save_leaders_to_db)'
$ui = $ui -replace $pattern2, $newFunc

# Save
Set-Content "src/ui/url_chat_interface.py" $ui -Encoding UTF8

Write-Host "✅ Function replaced successfully!"
```

## What the Universal Extractor Does

### Works with ANY website structure:

1. **Leadership Sections** - Finds sections with keywords like:
   - "leadership", "team", "management", "executive"
   - "our team", "meet the team", "about us"
   - "board", "founders", "staff"

2. **Multiple Layouts** - Handles:
   - Card-based layouts (most common)
   - List-based layouts (ul/ol)
   - Heading-based (h1-h6)
   - Table-based
   - Plain text patterns

3. **Smart Detection**:
   - ✅ Validates names (2-5 words, proper capitalization)
   - ✅ Scores titles by importance (CEO=10, Director=7, etc.)
   - ✅ Avoids testimonial sections
   - ✅ Finds images for each person
   - ✅ Extracts profile URLs

4. **Priority Scoring**:
   - CEO, CTO, CFO, COO = Priority 10
   - President, Founder = Priority 9
   - Directors = Priority 7-8
   - Heads, Managers = Priority 5-7

### Example websites it will work with:
- ✅ https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
- ✅ https://microsoft.com/about/leadership
- ✅ https://google.com/about/management
- ✅ https://apple.com/leadership
- ✅ https://[any-company].com/team
- ✅ https://[any-company].com/about-us

## Test It

After replacing the function:

1. Go to http://localhost:8503
2. Try these URLs:
   - https://amzur.com/leadership-team/
   - https://www.tesla.com/about
   - https://stripe.com/about
   - Any company's team/leadership page

3. Click "Extract Leadership"

4. You should see all leaders with correct names and titles!
